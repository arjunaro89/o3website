				<h2>The Coffee Can Portfolio</h2>
				<hr>
                <p class="italics">An active – passive portfolio to stand the test of time..<br>

                    To beat the market is not easy. In addition to a good investment manager, the investor needs perspective, patience and courage - qualities that do not abound in today’s intensely competitive world.<br>
Robert G.Kirby from his original paper titled The Coffee Can Portfolio (fall 1984)<br>

</p>
				<p>While the mutual fund industry in India continues to clock record inflows, one needs a reality check on how the mutual funds have scored in terms of returns to the investors. How does the average mutual fund return fare against the general market? From the universe of mutual funds, what percentage of them actually fare better than the general market?
                </p>
			
            
            
            
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				
				<p>This question takes importance, in the light of an investor being able to easily mimic the performance of the general market, via an ETF. This low-cost product is now a disruptor and brings forth serious questions whether to look at investing in a high-fee, under-performing mutual fund, or to simply opt for a low cost product which assures the market (average) return.
                <br>
				Robert Kirby built the iconic Global Fund Capital International, a story which has been immortalized in the eponymously titled book by the legendary <a href=" http://www.amazon.in/Capital-Story-Long-Term-Investment-Excellence/dp/0471735876">Charles Ellis</a><br>
                    I got to read this book a few years back and as I followed the trail, I came across this wonderful paper authored by Rob Kirby drawing from the deep experience of his career which I have borrowed and made the base for this article. <br>
                    The paper, The Coffee Can Portfolio, https://thetaoofwealth.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/the-coffee-can-portfolio.pdf  see’s Kirby studying the whole Active vs Passive debate and suggesting if the idea is to beat the costs involved in trading to achieve better investment returns, why buy the entire   Index  of S&amp;P 500? Instead build a select portfolio of companies achieving superior earnings and hold them for a decade or more with no rebalancing. This way you save all the costs, since even the “Passive” index gets rebalanced annually, many times for reasons not related to a company’s earnings performance.<br>
                    He observed this process of rebalancing, apart from the costs, takes away partial amounts of money from the recently successful stocks and invests in stocks which are lagging recently , to quote Kirby :<br>
                    <p class="italics">“..process results in a stream of capital being transferred from the most dynamic companies, which usually appear somewhat overvalued, to the least dynamic companies, which usually appear somewhat undervalued.”</p><br>
                    The Coffee Can Portfolio incident occurred in the early days of Kirby’s career as an Investment Counselor. The Coffee can name came as it reminded Kirby of the days in the past where people used to toss their valuables in a coffee can and put it away safely.<br>
                    A client of his, lawyer by profession handled the portfolio of his wife and used to interact with Kirby and on his advice was buying and selling stocks. This relationship continued for over a decade, until the Husband died suddenly one day.<br>
                    The wife inherited his estate and called on Kirby stating she would be adding her husband’s portfolio and would send the list of stocks over.<br>
                    The moment of reckoning happened when Kirby and team got the list of her husband’s portfolio, they realized he had been piggybacking the stock ideas of Kirby’s firm but with a twist. He purchased about $5000 worth of stock on every recommendation but never sold them, instead he put them away safely in a locker.<br>
                    The results were notable, he had a small holding of stocks with value of around $2000, a few large holdings of around $ 100,000 and one jumbo holding of $ 800,000 worth more than his wife’s entire portfolio. This was from a small purchase of a company called Haloid, which later became multiple shares of Xerox Corporation.<br>
                    <p class="italics">The investment counsel business, as it is traditionally practiced, and probably as it should be practiced, is a simple process of making sure that clients never have so much risk exposure that their capital or standard of living can be impaired by some specific negative surprise.</p><br>
                    <p>Robert G.Kirby (The Coffee Can portfolio)</p><br>
                    As the Coffee can portfolio beat Kirby’s meticulously researched portfolio, he reckoned constructing a portfolio of quality companies which remained undisturbed for a decade can actually do wonders for the returns. He did reckon who would have the patience to stay that long with no activity, because it is the very nature of humans to seek activity. This reminds me of two quotes from Warren Buffet : <br>
                    *Lethargy, bordering on sloth should remain the cornerstone of an investment style.<br>
                    *An investor should act as though he had a lifetime decision card with just twenty punches on it.<br>
                These two thoughts from the legend himself can make us agree to the approach of the Coffee Can.<br>
                <p>
Closer home, we had our mother’s and grandmother’s tucking away money and other valuables in the Bournvita can, the Indian version of Coffee can.</p>
<p>Saurabh Mukherjea of Ambit Capital has done research in Indian markets on the Coffee Can Portfolio and this stands to the findings of Kirby. Saurabh and his  team used  two quality filters, of ROCE of 15%  and revenue growth of at least 10% . using data from 1991 to 2000 they created portfolios using the two filters for each of the last 15 years.</p>
                <p>
The results were smart to say the least, the portfolios did better than the Indian Sensex by 5% to 15%.
With these experiences, we could start looking to discipline ourselves to selecting good companies buying them and putting them away in the proverbial Coffee Can Portfolio and wait for it to brew into superior returns.
But the question is will we? Will the human mind let us do this?</p>
