				<h2>Smart Beta!!</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>While the mutual fund industry in India continues to clock record inflows, one needs a reality check on how the mutual funds have scored in terms of returns to the investors. How does the average mutual fund return fare against the general market? From the universe of mutual funds, what percentage of them actually fare better than the general market?

				<p>This question takes importance, in the light of an investor being able to easily mimic the performance of the general market, via an ETF. This low-cost product is now a disruptor and brings forth serious questions whether to look at investing in a high-fee, under-performing mutual fund, or to simply opt for a low cost product which assures the market (average) return.
                <br>
				For the savvy investor, it’s easy to understand that this narrative has been popularized by Warren Buffett. While he has championed active investing in his actions, he has been severely critical of active investing as a universe. In his idiosyncratic “put your money where your mouth is” style, he famously won a $1 Million bet favouring the low-cost Index to outperform high-fee hedge funds over a 10-year horizon.
                <br>
                    
                The construct of an ETF is pretty simple and straightforward. It simply mimics a chosen benchmark, in terms of selection and weighting. An index broadly represents the general market, and it is used as an indicator to get a sense of where the general market is headed. Take for example, the best proxy for the Indian market, the Nifty. The market capitalization of the Nifty 50 companies represents about ~65% of the total free float market capitalization in India. With an Index ETF, once can simply mimic the growth in the Indian stock market, which would roughly mirror the growth in the Indian economy.
                <br>
                
                Now, we bring to focus a relatively new concept in the Indian market – the Smart Beta.  A natural question arises on what a ‘Smart Beta’ brings to the table, and the answer lies in the drawbacks of active and passive investing. While active investing, on an average has produced mediocre results (below the market returns, net of fees), the drawback in passive investing lies in its construct.<br>
                
                An index is constructed with one major factor dominating the selection criteria – the market capitalization of the stock determining the weight of the stock, without much importance being given to the quality or any other fundamental factor for selection. Consider the below facts:<br>
                    
                * Almost half of the Nifty 50 companies have a profitability profile of less than 10% returns on capital employed for the underlying business.<br>
                * 30% of the Nifty 50 companies generate about ~70% of the total Nifty profits.<br>
                * During the last five years, only half of the Nifty 50 companies generated free cash flows consistently for at least three out of the five years.<br>
                <p>
                Now, to add to this glaring gorge, consider the following. As of 31 August 2017, the HDFC twins contributed a massive 17% to the index, by weightage. This means, an investor buying an ETF would technically be deploying about 17% of his portfolio into these stocks, purely because of the market capitalization weighting rule of the index ETF. While the HDFC twins undoubtedly continue to run their business in a stellar fashion, their stock prices often trade at sometimes eye-popping premium valuations.
                </p>
                <p>
                Now, as a prudent investment, do the HDFC twins warrant such a high weightage?<br>
                Let us understand the drawbacks of a blind, or a dumb ETF further (dumb due to it being agnostic of quality and fundamentals). Currently, Reliance Industries constitutes ~7% to the Nifty weight. In a hypothetical scenario, assume Reliance doubles in its price, and the other stocks remain constant – Reliance’s weight in the portfolio now goes up to ~13%. To an investor buying an ETF, he would end up allocating about 13% of his money to Reliance. To beat it out to a simple idea, an ETF allocates a higher weight to an overvalued security!</p>
                <p>
                Things get really drastic in a bubble scenario, where higher weights are assigned to overvalued stocks, and once the bubble bursts, it pushes the portfolio into a significant setback. Simple, prudent rules, other than a blind market-capitalization method provides for passive investing, in an intelligent way. To give a current context, the ‘financial services’ sector continues to trade at hyper-valuations, supported by all sorts of stories regarding their growth. To no surprise, the ‘financial services’ sector now contributes to a staggering 35% weight to the Nifty! By any means, prudent investing would never allow for allocating 35% of one’s money to a richly, or probably an overvalued sector!
                </p>
                <p>
                So what’s the deal regarding Smart Beta, you may ask? Smart Beta is a solution to plug the loopholes of the active and passive investing activities described above. Such strategies avoid the pitfalls of active investing, which often entail a frequent churn to the portfolio, concentrated positions, research biases, as well as the cons of a single-factor (market-weighted) passive strategy. Smart Beta techniques circumvent the market-weighted-only index by using ‘fundamental factors’, often multiple of them to create a basket of securities. Being a rule-based strategy, it keeps most of the behavioural biases out of the picture, a common pitfall to active investing. While Smart Beta investing has gained popularity in the West, it is yet in a seed stage in the Indian market scenario. We endeavour to provide maximum advantage to our clients via the Smart Beta route, which we believe is the most optimal way towards portfolio building. Do keep a tab on this space for more!
